# Data Analysis on Airbnb

## Overview
This project involves a comprehensive data analysis of Airbnb listings using Python. The objective was to process, analyze, and visualize large datasets to extract meaningful insights regarding Airbnb property performance. The analysis covered topics such as property availability, pricing trends, and geographical distribution.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Altair, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebooks

## Dataset
The analysis was performed on datasets related to Airbnb listings, including:
- **Cities_Populations.xlsx:** Contains population data for various cities.
- **EU_Cities_Nights.xlsx:** Details the number of nights booked for properties in European cities.
- **London_Nights.xlsx:** Focused on Airbnb bookings in London.

## Key Files
- `AirbnbResults.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis and visualizations.
- `airbnb.ipynb`: Supporting notebook for additional analysis.
- **Listings Folder:** Contains additional data related to specific Airbnb listings.

## Features
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handling missing values
   - Data cleaning and formatting
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Examining trends in pricing and availability
   - Identifying top-performing properties and locations
3. **Data Visualization:**
   - Interactive visualizations with Altair
   - Static plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn

## Insights
- The analysis revealed trends in property pricing and booking durations across different cities.
- Certain locations consistently outperformed others in terms of occupancy rates.
- Seasonal trends were identified, helping to predict periods of high demand.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iwannaefraimia/Data-Analysis-on-Airbnb.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Data-Analysis-on-Airbnb
   ```
3. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook AirbnbResults.ipynb
   ```

## Future Work
- Incorporate machine learning models to predict property performance.
- Expand the dataset to include more cities and additional metrics.
